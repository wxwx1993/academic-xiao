Xiao Wu is a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University, where he is advised by Dr. Francesca Dominici. His research interests lie at developing causal inference methods to address methodological needs in the analysis of massive . My dissertation work focuses on developing real-time regression methods for both cross-sectional and longitudinal- or cluster-correlated data streams, advised by Professor Peter X.K. Song. Now I am working on a project to handle data streams with dynamic heterogeneity in state space mixed model.
